				<p>Design is an inclusive process requiring collaboration of
					product owner, business analysist and developers. We analyze user
					needs and user behavior to come up with user personas and user
					stories. This gives us enough input to start prototyping and come
					up with first drafts of wireframes. The wireframes are then
					converted to high definition designs based on feedback from client
					and the product owner. We take a mobile first approach to Design
					and its implementation and all our deliveries include Responsive
					designs for the 3 major form factors -- Mobile, Laptop and tablet.
					We take a pixel to pixel design approach to our projects. Drupal
					Campus Ambassador Program - A community Initiative: A wildcard
					entry into Dries’s keynote and Holly’s closing-note at Drupalcon
					Asia, DCAP made its humble beginnings in one of India’s regional
					events, where business folks were trying to find answers to Drupal
					talent problems. In spirit of Drupal community’s do-ocracy some of
					the community members figured a WIN-WIN solution for the problem,
					that is to take Drupal to colleges and evangelise it
					professionally. There have been numerous college workshops but DCAP
					is different in ways that it provides longevity and support to
					college students and that is exactly what Rakhi will be sharing at
					Higher-ed summit -- a bit of the history, successes so far and
					brave new world Drupal will foray into through DCAP. Catch Rakhi in
					action on May 9 at DrupalCon New Orleans.</p>
